# parsed_ru_corpuses
I've dealed with some Russian text corpuses, and parced them for some tasks. So, you can find here code for it.

I warn you they could hide some mistakes or inaccuracies. If you noticed something, feel free to notify me about that.

* **Lenta tagged texts 2 csv 4 NLU task.ipynb**
